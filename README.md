# Tigrinya-Dialect-Identification
This repo describes the dialect identification of Tigrinya from text using machine learning. From prior works in linguistics, we synthesized and categorized Tigrinya dialects into three (L, Z, and D). Then we systematically collected datasets for each dialect and performed experiments using classical machine learning and deep learning methods. 

The Tigrinya Dialect Identification (TDI) dataset contains text on three Tigrinya dialects or varieties namely: Z, D, and L. The purpose of this dataset is to study dialect identification for Tigrinya using machine learning.
For the Z variety, we used snippets from the book ኽልተ ዛንታት (Kilte Zantatat). For the L variety, we used book chapters from ፋቶ (Fato) and ዕርቂ እንደርታ (Erqi Enderta). For the D variant, we could not find a book. Instead, we collected data from two Facebook users, Akeza Awalom and Guraya Asadi Raya that consistently write in that variety.  Sentences collected for each dialect were translated to the other dialect with expert native speakers in the target dialect.
