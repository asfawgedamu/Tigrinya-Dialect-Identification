# Tigrinya-Dialect-Identification
This repo describes the dialect identification of Tigrinya from text using machine learning. From prior works in linguistics, we synthesized and categorized Tigrinya dialects into three (L, Z, and D). Then we systematically collected datasets for each dialect and performed experiments using classical machine learning and deep learning methods.
